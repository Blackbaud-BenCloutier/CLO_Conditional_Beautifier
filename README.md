----------------------------------

Version: 0.2
Live version: 0.2

This is the beta version of CLO Conditional Beautifier which will take some or all of the following types of code (HTML, CSS, JS, Convio Conditionals) and create a fully-beautified document as a result.

The live version can be found [here](http://vateam.convio.net/site/PageServer?pagename=CLO_Conditional_Beautifier).

**Current live features:**

Beautifies Convio Conditionals

Runs a basic minification algorithm on any source file, simply stripping the file of all unnecessary whitespace

**Features scheduled for future releases:**

Beautify HTML (partially complete)

Beautify CSS

Beautify JS

Recognize logic that calls for inline conditionals rather than beautified ones

More advanced minification algorithm that shortens variable names

Include beautification options that can: leave code as-is, indent with tabs or spaces, accept different indentation preferences
